            Hello, my name is Nikki Hess! I'm a junior at the University of Michigan studying computer science. 
            I'm an aspiring game developer, and I'm currently taking EECS 498 studying extended reality development in game engines.
            I currently have a little experience in Unity and Unreal 5, and am hoping to get a lot more in the future!
            Please pardon the simplicity of the site. I'm not much of a front-end developer yet.
