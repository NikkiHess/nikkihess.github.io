                Hello, my name is Nikki Hess! I'm a junior at the University of Michigan studying computer science.
                I'm an aspiring game developer, and I'm currently taking EECS 498 studying extended reality development in game engines.
                <br>
                I currently have a little experience in Unity and Unreal 5, and am hoping to get a lot more in the future!
                <br>
                Please pardon my dust while I work on the site. I'm not much of a front-end developer.
            </p>
